Thank you for visiting the file, hope I will be able to deliver instructions easily!

This is the main library, containing all needed classes (like configurators, contributors to rule runners and so on).

You can  add reference to this library inside solution or use it as external library, without any additional instalations, like it is done in the test api project 
inside the soluction (RateLimiter.API).

In order to keep code clean and reusable -  keep your options for rate limiting rules configuration in user application, not in this common library.

Thank you!
